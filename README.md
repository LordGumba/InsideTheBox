# InsideTheBox
# Overview

This is a phone game that I thought would be simple, but that people could still enjoy.

The game was simple, you simply keep the ball from hitting the wall by tapping in front of it. The ball progressively gets faster.


Here is me explaining what the code does in a video.

# Development Environment

I used Android studio to create this.

The language I made it in was Java. I was going to do use Javascript, but the I couldnt find the libraries to make shapes and touch recievers, so I went with Java.

# Useful Websites

I used these websites to make the site.

- [Android Studios? Developers? Idk which.](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp)

# Future Work

Here are some improvements I might make to the game.

- Actually work
- A swipe reflect rather than just touch
- A leader/score board
